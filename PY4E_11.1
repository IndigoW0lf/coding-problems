# The basic outline of this problem is to read the file, 
# look for integers using the re.findall(), looking for a regular 
# expression of '[0-9]+' and then converting the extracted strings to 
# integers and summing up the integers.

import re

inp = input('Enter a file:')
handle = open(inp)
numlist = []

for line in handle :
    line = line.rstrip()
    integers = re.findall('([0-9]+)',line)

    for number in integers:
        numlist.append(int(number))
    
print(sum(numlist))
