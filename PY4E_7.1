Write some code that asks for a file from the user, reads the file and returns the file in uppercase. 


fname = input('Enter a file path:')
try:
    fh = open(fname)
    for line in fh:
        lines = line.rstrip()
        print(lines.upper())
except:
    print('File cannot be opened')
    quit()
