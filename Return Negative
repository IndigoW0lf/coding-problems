In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

My Solution:

public class Kata {

  public static int makeNegative(final int x) {
      return (x < 0) ? x : -x; 
  }
  
}

Best solutions (to study):

import static java.lang.Math.abs;

public class Kata {

  public static int makeNegative(final int x) {
    return -abs(x);
  }
  
}
